dooby
=====

A **very simplistic** command-line to-do list manager in Ruby. 

WARNING!!!
-------

You should know this gem lacks of fancy things, meaning: social, cloud, mobile, web interface, etc.

Special Thanks
--------------

Most of the the ideas to code **dooby** were based on the work of other programmers, here's a list of all of them:

**Gina Trapani** ([http://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli](http://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli "todo.txt-cli"))  
**Lakshan Perera** ([http://github.com/laktek/todo](http://github.com/laktek/todo))  
**Scott Chacon** ([http://github.com/schacon/ticgit](http://github.com/schacon/ticgit))

Thanks all of you!

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
